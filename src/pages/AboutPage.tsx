                As the Founder and CEO of Innovission, my journey began with a simple observation — students often struggle to connect academic theory with real-world application. That realization sparked the creation of Innovission, a student-driven initiative designed to close this gap through innovation, collaboration, and hands-on learning.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                What started as a passion project — sharing insights on coding, design, and career development — has evolved into a dynamic platform where learners become creators. Through workshops, mentorship, and content, we've fostered a growing movement that aligns with our mission: "Upskill Bharat."
              </p>
              <p>
                The path has had its challenges, but the impact on students’ growth and confidence drives our vision forward. Today, Innovission stands as a thriving hub led by passionate minds, reaching hundreds of learners across the country. And we’re just getting started. Join us as we continue to shape a future where education meets opportunity, and innovation fuels change.
